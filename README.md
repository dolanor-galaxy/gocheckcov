## Status

## Description
cov-analyzer allows users to assert that a set of golang packages meets a minimum level of test covreage. Users supply a coverage profile generated by `go test -coverprofile` and a path to a tree of golang packages. Users can specify a minimum coverage percentage for all packages or specify a minimum for each package via a configuration file.

```
$ cov-analyzer check --profile-file cp.out --minimum-coverage 66.6 $GOPATH/src/github.com/bar/foo/pkg/baz

pkg github.com/bar/foo/pkg/baz coverage is 10% (10/100 statements)
coverage 10% for package github.com/bar/foo/pkg/baz did not meet minimum 66.6%
```
